/** @file
 *
 * @brief example on how to get detections of the PAL Textured Object published when it is
 *        shown to REEM-C close, which are published by the texture_detector node.
 *
 *        This example will subscribe to the image topic stereo/left/image and the
 *        topic texture_detector/detection to get synchronized pairs.
 *        Then, it will show with rectangles the image region where the PAL Textured Object
 *        is detected when so.
